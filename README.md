## Case Top

The case top has a couple of different options:

 * Ahokore-Top-Heatset-Plate.stl
 * Ahokore-Top-Heatset-Slipover.stl
 * Ahokore-Top-Tapping-Plate.stl
 * Ahokore-Top-Tapping-Slipover.stl

You only need one of these, here's how to decide which one:

### Heatset or Tapping

The heatset variant has big holes for inserting heatset inserts (which can be
pressed in with a soldering iron).

Supported heatset inserts are M2 3mm wide, up to 3mm long.

These make a much more resilient screw hole but obviously requires you to have
heatset inserts on hand, so there's an alternative variant with smaller holes
that you can screw an M2 screw into directly.

 * Choose "Heatset" if you have heatset inserts
 * Choose "Tapping" if you do not have heatset inserts and want to screw directly into plastic

### Plate or Slipover

The case was originally designed with an integrated plate which makes things a
bit more solid and stable, but obviously means desoldering your switches to
install it. So there's an alternative "slipover" version that will slide over
your switches so you don't need to desolder.

 * Choose "Plate" if you haven't installed your switches yet
 * Choose "Slipover" if you have installed switches and don't want to desolder them

## Base

The base is optional

Recommended screws are M2 5mm Countersunk (although non-countersunk screws also
work).

If you want to go without the base, then you'll need M2 4mm button head screws
(don't use countersunk for this configuration!)

## Battery Cover

The battery cover is also optional, it's big enough to (just) fit a massive
2400MAh battery, so pretty much anything should fit under there.

Currently it's just push fit into the battery cutout (this probably needs
improvement!)
